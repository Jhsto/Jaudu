# Jaudu â€” Websocket powered CSRF protection
   Jaudu is CSRF protection which uses websockets instead of cookies and session, resulting in tokens which cannot be parsed from DOM. Since many crackers and spammers use this method to bypass CSRF, Jaudu provides extra protection compared to formal CSRF protections. Jaudu also supports client side form timelocks and IP banning, which can be easily added by modifying jaudu.js javascript file.

##Pre-requirements:
   [Redis](http://redis.io/) - Jaudu uses redis to store keys

##Installation:   
1. ```$ npm install jaudu```
2. Customize your choice of jaudu.js from /js folder. Please see docs folder for more information.

##Usage:
```javascript
var jaudu = require('jaudu');

// Connect to redis host
jaudu.Database(<redis_host>, <redis_password>, <port>);

app.configure(function(){
// Add bodyParser middleware if you already don't have it enabled
app.use(express.bodyParser());
// Add jaudu middleware
app.use(jaudu);
});
```

##Defaults
   By default Jaudu will start websocket server on port 3012.
